                <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
                <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls
                    without the use of ropes or harnesses. </p>
                <p>Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing" target="_blank">traditional
                        climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping
                    climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>

            <p>Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both <strong>accessible to beginners
                    and endlessly challenging for experts</strong>.</p>
